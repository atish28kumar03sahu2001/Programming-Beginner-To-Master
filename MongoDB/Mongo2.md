## Mongo DB

MongoDB is an open-source, document-oriented No SQL database management system. A document database, also known as a document-oriented database or a document store, stores information in documents. Designed for flexibility, scalability, and performance in handling unstructured or semi-structured data.

it was created by a company called 10gen, which is now known as MongoDB, Inc. The company was founded by Eliot Horowitz and Merriman in 2007. The first version of MongoDB was released in 2009.

## SQL VS Mongo DB

SQL databases are relational databases. SQL uses structured tables to store data in rows and columns. SQL is suitable for applications with well-defined schemas and fixed data structures. E-commerce platform and HR Management etc. Example: My SQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.

No SQL databases are non-relational databases. They provide flexibility in data storage, allowing varied data types and structures. ideal for applications with dynamics or evolving data models. Examples: CMS(Content Management System), Social Media Platforms, and Gaming. Example: MongoDB, Cassandra, Radix.

## Key Features Of Mongo DB

1. Flexible Schema Design MongoDB allows dynamic schema-less data structures. Easily accommodate change data requirements.

2. Scalability & Performance Horizontal Scaling supports large datasets and high traffic. Optimized read and write operations for fast performance.

3. Document-Oriented Storage Data is stored in flexible JSON-like BSON documents. self-contained units with rich data types and nested arrays.

4. Dynamic Queries Rich query language with support for complex queries. utilize indexes to speed up query execution.

5. Aggregation Framework Perform advanced data transformations and analysis. Process data using multiple pipeline stages.

6. Open source and community MongoDB is open-source with a vibrant community. Regular updates improvements and support.

## JSON Vs BSON

In MongoDB, we write JSON format only but behind the scenes, data is stored in BSON (Binary JSON) format, a binary representation of JSON.

By utilizing BSON, MongoDB can achieve higher read and write speeds, reduced storage requirements, and improved data manipulation capabilities making it well-suited for handling large and complex datasets while maintaining performance efficiency.
